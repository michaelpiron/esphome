This component is work in progress.

open issues at this moment:
* Which are the connections between ESP and ADE chip? I have to know which GPIO pins of the ESP are connected to the IRQ’s of the ADE. I can’t see this visually on the PCBs without desoldering the top and bottom PCB, and even then I’m not sure if it can be deduced from the PCB tracks.
* There are quite some calibration constants to figure out. Anyone who is familiar with this or who could reverse engineer it from the Shelly 3PM firmware binary?
